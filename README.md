# Free-da

Patches to make frida-core more resistant to root-detection tools. Based on work [here](https://github.com/hluwa/Patchs).  

Ideally we will have build solutions here sometime. For now its mostly just an example of
using [Shipyard](https://github.com/micahjmartin/Shipyard) with CodePatches

## Notes
frida-core does not use tags, so Shipyard only applies the patches to a single version of the code.
